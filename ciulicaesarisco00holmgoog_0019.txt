x HOW CAESAR WROTE THE coMMENPARIEu

we are told that they vigorously attached Quintus Cicera
and in vii, 75, § 3 Caesar says that they were called upon

to contribute 6,000 meu to the army which attempted to
relieve Vercingetorix. Again, in vi, 2, 1 3 Caesar affirms
that ‘all the Cisrhenane Germans’, who included the
Segni and Condrusi, were in arms against him: in vi, 31,
11 1-2 he implies that these two tribes proved their inno ,
00000. But many of the Nervians who fought against
Cicero had doubtless been too young to fight three years
before ; the statement that the tribe was wellnigh exter
minated may have been only a rhetorical flourish, based
upon misleading reports, which Caesar or his secretary
had not had time or inclination to sift; and the incensis
tency between vi, 2and vi, 31 only proves that he did
001 thoroughly revise his work. Even real inconsisten-
cies, which are very few, can be accounted for by hasty
use of discordant materiale, lapse of memory, or mere
carelessness.

It may be regarded, then, ae certain that Caesar wrote
the Cornnwntariee alter the campaign of 52 a.c.; and the
only question is whether„he wrote them in the winter
following that campaign or later. 1 am not sure that he
would have had time to write thern in the winter; for ’
from the very beginning of 51 he was hard at work, cam·
paigniug against the Bituriges and other tribes. Momm·
sen, indeed, argues (uer. ofnome, v, 1895, p. aaa, n. 1) l
that the book must have been not only written but puh
lished before the end of 51, because in vii, 6, § 1 Caesar
‘ approves the exceptional laws [passed under the influenoe
of Pompey] of 702’ (52 nu), and he could 001 have done
this after his rupture with Pompey, when he reversed

’ Βο1 why should not the publication have talren place in
50 0. c.,—the year before that in which the civil war
began? It seems to me most probable that it did, for
this was the only year between Caesar‘s first consulship
and the last year of his life in which he wasnot fighting;
aud, as far as we know, he was theu comparatively at
leisure (Ouesur's eosquos osGuul, pp. 202-10). Scep. 43⁶.
