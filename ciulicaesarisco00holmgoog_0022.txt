ff THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES xiii

Professor A. Klotz (meinans Muscam, 1910, pp. 224-
³ 111) thinks that the foregoing pedigree, which has been
J? generally accepted, is incorrect He believes, with Pro·
ξ, mesor B. Kubler, that the archetype 11 all the extant
ἶ uss was a copy belonging to β, and that α 11 descended
lrom a copy belonging to the same group, in which read·
ings 111111 a manuscript of the sixth century, published
by two editors-Julius Celsus Constantinus and Flavius
Licerius Firminus Lupicinus-were inserted. Accord-
ingly Klotz has constructed this pedigree, which, in the
opinion ο1 Meusel (Jobresbcricbtc des nhinlopieaen Vereins

The two groups, α and β, differ 111111 each other about
1‚.500 times, and an editor cannot do without either.
But when they differ and neither is obviously wrong,
how is he tc decide between thern? Simply, in most
cases, by considering the context or by carefully noting
Caesar’s use of language in passages 111 which the two
groups agree. 'l'his laborious task hasbeen performed
by various critice, notably by three German scholare,
Rudoll Schneider, Meusel, and Allred Klotz. Let me
give one 111111 examples. In v, 35, 1 5 α has (cum
a prima luce ad horam octavam) pugnaretur, β has
praenossent. 'Phe former is preferable because Caesar in
describing the duration 11 a battle almost always uses
the passive. In vii, 64, §2ab have (peditatu quem
ante) 1111111111 fore contentum 1111111, while the rest
of the β MSS. have 1111111111, which is certainly right,
because the relative clause is part of what Vercingetorix
said, and therefore the subjunctive is necessary. But in
some cases the claims ol α and β appear to be equally
balanced ; and here, lor reasons which Ι have given in the
Classical Reuiew oi 1001 (p. 175), Ι follow with Meusel
the reading of α.
