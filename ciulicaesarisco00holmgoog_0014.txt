PREFACE v

The High Master of St. Paul's School, to whom
I am grateful, has read nearly all my manuscript;
and, after considering his suggestions, I wrote some
additional notes, struck out one or two, and modified
a few others; but he is not responsible for anything
which this book contains.

I have thought it right to confine myself in the
notes to explaining Caesar's text. Various historical
commenta and other remarks which may be helpful‚
but which would have been out of place in an edition
of the Oomcwotories, are to be found in Part I of my

vivid than even the best mapa and plans can make
them. Ihave given on pages 447-ss directions as to
the best way of reaching the various places which

It is now usual in English schools to read the
classica in suippets‚ partly, l suppose, in order that
boys may become acquainted with many authors
before they leave school But by following this plan
they cannot become intimate with any. One may
read Macaulay's essay on Clive with profit even if
one ignores all the others; but to read the ninth
chapter only of his History of Errylond would not
be wise. Moreover, there is no reason, apart from the
consideration of what subjects are most remunerative,
why Caesar should only be used asan elementary
text-book. lt cannot be read with the maximum of
profit bya young hoy, and it ought to be read rapidly
through, at least once, hy the highest form in the

school. In saying this I have the support of the
late High Master of St. Paula, who told me that
