THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES xv

that 1 regard it cs open to suspicion, though some
bracketed words are certainly spurious. The obvious
emendations, of which 1 have already given two examples,
and which, as a rule, 1 have adopted silently‚ will be
ionnd in Mensel's critical edition. The principle to which
Ihave adhered is never to incorporate an emendation in
the text, even when 1 am inclined to believe that it
represents what Caesar wrote, unless the MS. reading or
readings seem indefensible. When, for instance, one finds
that in vii, 10, § 1 exponentis is used in a sense which
the verb has nowhere else in Caesar, and never in
Cicero or in Sallust, one ieels the necessity oi cantion.

Nom-When Ι quote readings adopted by hieusel which are not
in his textos 1894, they are to bo found in the reissue of his school
edition (1⁹08) unless I state that he has adopted them since.
