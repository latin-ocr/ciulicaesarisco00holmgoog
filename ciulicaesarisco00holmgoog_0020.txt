THE ΤΕΧΤ OF THE COMMENTARIES

- Evenv one who can read the Commentariea with interest
will want to know how lar the manuscripts iu which
ι they have been handed down to us correspond with what
Caesar wroto; tor if he will think, he will see that noue
ol them correspond with it exaotly‚ and that although
scholare have been tryiug ever since 1469, when the first

printed edition was published, to remove tho errore, ⁸

many must still and always will remain. The oldest oi
the extant manuscripts was written fully 900 years atter
the book was first put into circulatiou. Now, however
caretul a scribe may be, ho can hardly avoid making
some mistakes in copying out a written book ; tbe scribe
who copies his copy will make more ; and soon. Even
contemporary copies ot (laesar’s original manuscript
doubtless contained mistakes. Cicero¹ complains that
books sold by the booksellers of Rome had been care
lsssly copied ; and, notwithstanding all the care of prooi-
readers, few modern books are entirely free lrom printers'
errors Resides, a manuscript might paee into the hands
ot a reader who would make notes on the margin 3 and it
another· copy were to be made from the oue which con-
tained these notes, the copyist might be misled into
incorporating them in the text. Thus two kinds ot mis·
takes would gradually find their way in. An example
of the latter kiudssnoctc intonuisse—will be found in
i. 27, ᾗ 4. An example of the other shows how even
a very carelul copyist might go astray. In viii, 32, ξ 2
the temous stronghold‚ Uxellodunum, is mentioned tor the
first time. Uxellodunum was only written by the copyist
in two of the good manuscripts: the rest have auxilio
dunum, which, as every oue will see, is nonsense. Can
you imagine how this ourioue blunder was made? In
this way. Iu some manuscripta reader wrote either
in the margin or above uxellodunum (not Uxellodunum,
for even proper names were written with snaall initial
letters) the words a. ucillodunum, aud by a., which was an
