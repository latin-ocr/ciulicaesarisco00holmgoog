iv PREFACE

should be impracticable, ιο read them aloud them·
solves. I feel less diffidence in making this suggestion
because it bas been made already by well-known
oritics as well as by the Curriculo Committes of the
Classical Association, aud because the books which
I have named have been in part translated into
German for the use of schools. If, before a boy
begins to grapple with Caesar's Latin, he has got
a general notion of the whole story, he will work with
far more beart.

The principle to which I have adhered in writing
my notes has been ιο avoid giving any information
which the learner can easily acquire for himself
through the medium of grammar, dictionary, or such
other books as he may fairly be supposed to have.
My aim has been not to save him the laboun—if
Ι had done sobe would only have been bored-but to
let him feel the pleasure of thinking3 and I have
therefore tried, as far as was possible with due regard
to space, to appeal toliis reason,—not only to state
results, but to enable him to follow the steps by
which they were attained. Merely inform a pupil that
Alesia was situated on Mont Auxois, and you will
profit him little, for cut-and-dried informatiou is
indigestible3 but make him understand that it was
there and that to suppose that it was anywhere else
involves absurdities, and you will set his intellect to
work. Idesireindeedtoappealnotonlytothelearner's
reason but also to his scepticism and his latent critical
acumen. I should be glad to hear that lre had tried
to pick holes in my arguments; for I do not wish
him to accept thern until he is convinced that they
are sound. For the benefit of any one who may bc
disposed to test them, I have given at the end of
various notes references to my larger books; and
Ι hope that some readers may feel moved to gain such
a mastery of the subject as is nnattainable with a
succinet commentary.
