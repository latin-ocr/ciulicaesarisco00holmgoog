CORRIGENDA AND ADDENDA 461

,9, 5 2. interea. Even in an English translation ‘meanwhile' might
conveniently come first in the sentence3 ior, though interea
properly belongs 1ο maaet, it also serves as a connecting
particle. Ii it had been placed aiter ae, another particle
would be indispensable.

51. orabant. Schneider remarks that ii the envoys had made only
one aequest, and not also that denoted by mahat, Caesar
would hare written sternant. 1 doubt it: ei. rii, 78, 5 t.
The imperfect seems to me to show that the request was
urgently reiterated.

, 5 7. The mere ieet that Commius aras arrested on landing (27, 5 8)
provee nothing, ior the tribes oi south-Baetem Britain were
divided into antagonistic grenps (ΑΒ, p. 800); and ii
Caesar wrote his, not iis (which is constantly ooniounded
with it), hie regionibus may mean North-Essiam Gaul aeid
&nih-Enetern Britain, which were unitel by the olosost
ties (ila, pp. aaa-300).

, 5 9. nadad. It has been said that the legionarias on board the galley
could liare protected Volusenus! What sort 01⁴ a light eould
a few legionariae liare made? Volusenus, with all his
saults, iras no coward.

. 5 3. arrpuais. 1 might hare added that, as Mensel himself remarks,
prognati (ii, 29, 5 4111 poetioal, and that Caesar nsee brevitas
(ii, 30, 5 4> in a sense which is elsewhere only found in
poete and lato writers.

52. framentum. Thouglr standing corn is generally denoted by the
plural, there isan exception in ir, 32, 5 4. Perhaps, how·
ever, as Meusel suggests, the corn which Caesar ‘brought in
daily froin the tields’ had already been cut and staclred by
the Britons.

, 53. perlectionem.. .coasue›iat. Mensel, renrarlring that att in 11111111
. . ‚flectes undoubtedly reiers to the drivers‚ maintains that
they, and aot the warriors, must hare run along the pole.
What ior? They were not performing in a circus. The
earlier words, lta tantilitatem . , . ia proeliis, evidently refer to
the warriors as well aethe drivers3 and it is clear that the
subjectos the whole sentence is essedarii, i. e. warriors aad
drivera. Which of the two is to be thought oi as the subject
oi each verb, is leh to the reader's common sense.

51. pertarbatis icastris. Meusel, wlm agrees with me, remarks that
with auxiliataaserre Caesar generally uses a dative.

5 5. epulatus includes macnarii 133, 5 1.)

, 5 2. Schneider argues that aestro mari, by aririch most readers would
ausume that Caesar meant the Mediterraneum was only that
part ol' it which lay between Italy and Spain: but tho
passages which he cites (Sallust, Japartha, 17, 5 4; 18, 5 4 ;
Livy, 111142, 5 4; xxviii, 1, 5 3) only prove that the
Western Mediterranean was part oi acetrum more ; long before
Caesar’s time the Eastern Mediterranean had been a highway
oi tratllc with italy ; and Pomponius Mela (i, 1, 55 6-7) says
that the whole expansa between the Straits oi Gibralter and
the Sea oi Azoi was called Nostrum mare. Besides, it
Schneider iras right, Caesar distinguished between the ships
that sailed the Western Mediterranean and those that were
used in the various waters oi the East, which is improbable:
reliquie meritas raeans all the waters navigated by the
Romane, except the Atlantic.
